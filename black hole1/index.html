                The eye of the universe is the black hole, it's the essence, it's hairless, it's dull, it's a trap, wandering in the vast cosmos like a vampire, dead and dealy, mysterious and dangerous. 'THE BLACK HOLE IS THE WHOLE UNIVERSE'.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the early years, the universe was integral, pure, clear, honest and innocent. She gave birth to baby stars, shining stars, to keep company with her lonely soul. But there is a price to anything.
                <br>
                <br>
                Riddled with a hundred gaping wounds, hollowed with a thousands of holes, suffering endless physical torment...

            <p class="description2">As times passing by, the comos,  her young body bacame no longer smooth
               and plump, her mind bacame no longer pure and naive, as black hole devils were slowly eroding every part of her flesh, the dreadful devil, the dreadful balck hole, the monster in her heart.
            <br>
            <br>
            She's greedy like that devil, she's getting heavy to nourish that parasite. The evil parasite never feel full, it's getting larger, it's keeping on asking for blood, it's mutating.
            <br>
            <br>
            The universe, she is the mother, she is the kind, she is the angel, she is the devil; she made her life colorful, she made her life sick; she doesn't know how to be a parent, she only know how to sacrifice; until the day she knows, she is the dead...

                Annihilation

            <p class="end">The black hole is bloated, it turns into a meaingless combination of dead spirits of stars, matters,
            it's too ugly, too peculiar, it is the graveyard with only one enterance but no exit, it's too desperate, too sad. Or maybe there is another possible way for it lives, it would be full of fantasy worlds, nothing is meaingless, everything is different...
            <br>
            <br>
            But it still be a vampire from the outside, the cosmos, she knows, that the black hole itself is a devil, she knows, but she chooses to ignore, she chooses to let it be evil, she sometimes thinks it is the most beautiful creature she has ever made, she tends to be like it, she asks it to be her eye, she hopes it lives forever.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, 'THE BLACK HOLE IS THE UNIVERSE', the black hole controls the mind of universe, the mind is the best part of the universe, it's value is the same as the value of human consciousness, it's the representation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The mind is cold, dead and dealy, mysterious and dangerous... How powerful is this black hole monster? 
            Human beings will never know...
